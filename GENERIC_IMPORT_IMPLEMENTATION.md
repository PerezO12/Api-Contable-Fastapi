# Generic Import System Implementation Status

## Overview
The generic data import assistant has been successfully implemented with a modular, metadata-driven architecture inspired by Odoo's import system. The implementation provides a foundation for importing various data models with validation, mapping, and error handling.

## What's Implemented

### 1. Core Schemas (`app/schemas/generic_import.py`)
- **Complete**: All schemas for the import system including:
  - Model metadata definitions with field types and validation rules
  - Import session management schemas
  - File upload and analysis responses
  - Column mapping and preview structures
  - Execution and template management schemas

### 2. Model Metadata Registry (`app/services/model_metadata_registry.py`)
- **Complete**: Registry service that provides:
  - Metadata definitions for key models (third_party, product, account, invoice)
  - Field definitions with types, constraints, and validation rules
  - Mapping suggestion algorithms
  - Model discovery and validation

### 3. Import Session Service (`app/services/import_session_service_simple.py`)
- **Complete**: Simplified session management with:
  - File upload and temporary storage
  - CSV/Excel file analysis and column detection
  - Sample data extraction for preview
  - Session lifecycle management
  - Automatic data type inference

### 4. Validation Service (`app/services/generic_validation_service.py`)
- **Complete**: Row-level validation with:
  - Type checking and conversion
  - Required field validation
  - Length and format constraints
  - Many-to-one relationship validation
  - Custom validation rules support

### 5. REST API Endpoints (`app/api/v1/generic_import_simple.py`)
- **Implemented**: Core endpoints for:
  - `GET /models` - List available models for import
  - `GET /models/{model_name}/metadata` - Get model metadata and field definitions
  - `POST /sessions` - Upload file and create import session
  - `GET /sessions/{session_id}` - Get session details and sample data
  - `DELETE /sessions/{session_id}` - Clean up import session

- **Placeholder**: Advanced endpoints (ready for implementation):
  - `POST /sessions/{session_id}/mapping` - Configure column mappings
  - `POST /sessions/{session_id}/preview` - Preview import with validation
  - `POST /sessions/{session_id}/execute` - Execute actual import
  - `GET/POST /templates` - Template management

### 6. Import Execution Service (`app/services/import_execution_service.py`)
- **Implemented**: Basic structure for:
  - Batch processing logic
  - Validation integration
  - Database operations framework
  - Error handling and reporting

## Architecture Features

### Metadata-Driven Design
- Models are defined through metadata rather than hardcoded logic
- Field definitions include types, constraints, and validation rules
- Mapping suggestions based on field names and patterns
- Extensible to new models without code changes

### Session Management
- Temporary file storage with automatic cleanup
- Session-based workflow with expiration
- Sample data extraction for user preview
- Token-based session identification

### Validation Framework
- Row-level validation with detailed error reporting
- Type checking and automatic conversion
- Support for complex validation rules
- Many-to-one relationship validation

### RESTful API Design
- Clear separation between upload, mapping, preview, and execution
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Structured responses with detailed information
- Authentication and permission integration

## Usage Example

```python
# 1. Get available models
GET /api/v1/generic-import/models
# Returns: ["third_party", "product", "account", "invoice"]

# 2. Get model metadata
GET /api/v1/generic-import/models/third_party/metadata
# Returns: Field definitions, constraints, validation rules

# 3. Upload file and create session
POST /api/v1/generic-import/sessions
# Form data: model_name=third_party, file=data.csv
# Returns: Session token, detected columns, sample data

# 4. Get session details
GET /api/v1/generic-import/sessions/{session_id}
# Returns: Session info, file analysis, sample rows

# 5. Configure mappings (not yet implemented)
POST /api/v1/generic-import/sessions/{session_id}/mapping

# 6. Preview import (not yet implemented)
POST /api/v1/generic-import/sessions/{session_id}/preview

# 7. Execute import (not yet implemented)
POST /api/v1/generic-import/sessions/{session_id}/execute
```

## Integration with Application

The generic import system is integrated into the main FastAPI application:
- Added to API router in `app/api/v1/__init__.py`
- Available at `/api/v1/generic-import/*` endpoints
- Uses existing authentication and permission system
- Follows application error handling patterns

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Complete Advanced Endpoints
- Implement column mapping configuration
- Add preview functionality with validation
- Complete import execution with batch processing
- Add progress tracking for large imports

### 2. Enhanced Features
- Template management (save/load column mappings)
- Async/background processing for large files
- Real-time progress updates
- Advanced validation rules

### 3. Database Integration
- Implement actual database operations in execution service
- Add proper upsert logic per model
- Handle foreign key relationships
- Transaction management and rollback

### 4. User Experience
- Add CSV template download
- Improve error messages and validation feedback
- Add import history and logging
- Frontend integration support

### 5. Production Features
- File size limits and validation
- Rate limiting for uploads
- Audit logging
- Performance optimization
